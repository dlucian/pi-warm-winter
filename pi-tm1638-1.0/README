A simple interface to the TM1638 based displays for the Raspberry Pi.

Dealextreme, doubtless amongst others, sell small boards with eight
seven-segment displays, eight red-green LEDs and eight push buttons
for less than $10.

The boards are basically just the LEDs and switches, and a TM1638
driver chip. This sits on a two-wire serial bus which makes it
fairly easy to connect the boards to a computer/microcontroller of
your choice. Of course, one needs a little bit of software. This is
such a library for the Raspberry Pi.
